# Solmodoro
The Solmodoro is a Pomodoro timer app that I will create in order to promote its usage to study with.
Originally I would run a James Schulz stream vod on youtube, but that would involve opening chrome and consuming unnecessary RAM, on top of Youtube sometimes lagging after leaving the tab in the background for too long, ruining the audio.
This will be my first project that I will take part in to learn how to create Python Apps and a little bit of Data Analytics with the Tracker, all feedback is welcome.

## Solmodoro Features Include:
### 1. Pomodoro Timer+ (WIP)
The basic Pomodoro timer with extra features:
1. You can set how long you want your study and break sessions
2. When the study session ends, an alarm will sound. The break will only begin counting down when you click "Start Break/Study Session"
3. Extra time will be reduced from the next study session. Not sure if I want to do the same for the break timer.

### 2. Customizable BGM/Sound (WIP)
You can play 2 BGMs at the same time with varying volume, so you can mix 100% volume rain sounds with 25% volume lofi hip-hop beats
You can upload your own music files to use 
You can customize your alarm sound as well (I got the idea because I like the alarm that James Schulz uses)

### 3. Tracker (WIP)
My intention is to log the data I collect (time spent studying, breaks) into an excel sheet or maybe some more advanced graphic tool to track trends.
Have a questionnaire after I click "Stop Studying" to fill in more information like (Study quality, topic of study, nature of study, any interruptions)

### 4. Break Todo List (Unsure if I want it)
During study sessions, small button to write down some things that cross my mind mid session. Then view that list during break session.

Trivia: The name Solmodoro is a mix of Pomodoro and Solmi
